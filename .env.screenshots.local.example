# 🎯 Questerix Help-Doc Agent: Mission Guide & Manifest
# Path: .agent/HELP_DOC_AGENTS_GUIDE.mdf
# Version: 3.0 (Optimized for Pure Help-Doc App Integration)

## 🏁 Mission Objective
Perform autonomous end-to-end verification of the Questerix platform. Log in as various stakeholders, capture professional screenshots, and generate high-fidelity documentation intended for the standalone Help-Doc portal.

## �️ Phase 1: Architectural Context (The Questerix Philosophy)

### 1.1 Stakeholder Separation & Hub Layout
Questerix separates management from learning. The **Admin Panel** is a centralized hub for secondary stakeholders (Teachers/Parents), while the **Student App** is a distraction-free learning environment. Document these as distinct entry points for the end-user.

### 1.2 "Chameleon UI" (Role-Based Context)
The Admin Panel adapts dynamically based on the active group type:
- **Classrooms (Teacher)**: Professional **Blue theme**, rosters, and "Red Flag" performance alerts.
- **Family Groups (Parent)**: Soft **Purple theme**, focusing on individual kids and local nicknames.

### 1.3 Assignment Execution Protocol
Teachers/Parents don't just "give work"—the system uses an **Execution Protocol**:
- **Initialization**: Select a "Protocol" (e.g., **Skill Mastery**) and target a skill (e.g., "7th Grade Algebra Basics").
- **Authorization**: Set dead-lines and scope (**Mandatory** vs. **Suggested**).
- **Handshake Protocol**: Assignments sync via 6-character **Join Codes**. No student email required (COPPA compliant).

## 🎨 Phase 2: Documentation Design & SEO Best Practices

### 2.1 Technical SEO & Discoverability
- **Header Hierarchy**: Each article MUST have a single `<h1>` with keyword-rich subheadings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`).
- **Meta Descriptions**: Include a 150-160 character summary at the top of every markdown file for the Help-Doc search engine.
- **Alt Text**: Every screenshot must have descriptive alt-text for accessibility and indexability.

### 2.2 Visual Documentation Workflow
- **Embedded Screenshots**: Do not just show the screen; explain the workflow *while* the user looks at the image.
- **Annotation Focus**: Use callouts for "Directed Learning" badges in the Student App and "Ready for Execution" status in the Admin Panel.
- **Fidelity**: Capture the "Premium" look (glassmorphism, vibrant gradients). If it looks simple, you have failed.

### 2.3 Structural Efficiency (Atomic Documentation)
- **Shared Components**: Do NOT duplicate documentation for features shared by all roles (e.g., Account Settings, Login, Profile Editing).
- **Referencing**: Write shared features once in a `Shared Activities` section and link to them from role-specific guides.

## 📝 Phase 4: Help-Doc Output Protocol
- **Location**: All files go to `docs/user-manual/`.
- **Formatting**: GitHub-style Markdown.
- **Assets**: Snake_case image names in `docs/user-manual/assets/`.
- **Shared Reference Path**: `docs/user-manual/shared/`.

---

## 📖 Phase 5: Glossary & Terminology
- **Handshake Protocol**: The process of syncing assignments between Teacher/Parent and Student using a 6-character Join Code instead of email.
- **Directed Learning**: A focused learning mode in the Student App where specific skills are targeted and tracked via badges.
- **Execution Protocol**: The overarching workflow for assigning work (Initialization -> Authorization -> Handshake).

---

## 🤖 Phase 6: Automation Tips & Tooling
- **Screenshot Capture**: Use **Playwright** or **Puppeteer** for automated, high-fidelity captures. Ensure viewport sizes match standard desktop/mobile dimensions.
- **Annotation**: Use automated overlay scripts (e.g., ImageMagick, Canvas API) or manual tools like **Figma** or **Snagit** for callouts.
- **Markdown Generation**: Use template literals or Handlebars to inject dynamic content (like screenshot paths) into Markdown files.

---

## ⚠️ Phase 7: Error Handling & Resilience
- **Invalid Credentials**: Log the failure, skip the dependent test suite, and alert the user. Do not retry infinitely.
- **Inaccessible URLs**: Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff (e.g., 3 retries). If still failing, document the outage in the run logs.
- **Missing Selectors**: If a UI element changes, capture a full-page screenshot of the failure state and halt the specific documentation task.

## 📄 Phase 8: Output Examples
**Sample Markdown File:**

# How to Assign a Skill Mastery Protocol

**Problem**: You need to assign a specific math skill to your classroom.
**Solution**: Use the Execution Protocol to target the skill and generate a Join Code.

1. Navigate to the **Classrooms** tab.
2. Click **New Assignment** and select **Skill Mastery**.

*Alt text: The New Assignment modal with Skill Mastery highlighted.*

**Verification**: Ensure the 6-character Join Code is displayed on your dashboard.
```

## ✅ Phase 9: Verification Checklist
Before finalizing a document, verify the following:
- [ ] Does the document have a single `<h1>`?
- [ ] Is the 150-160 character meta description present at the top?
- [ ] Do all screenshots have descriptive alt-text?
- [ ] Are shared components referenced rather than duplicated?
- [ ] Is the tone empathetic and at an 8th-grade reading level?
- [ ] Does the guide follow the Problem → Solution → Verification format?

# 🚩 Essential Notes:
# - help_doc is a separate app with no internal Questerix/Cortex knowledge.
# - The guide MUST be self-contained and descriptive.
# - Use local test accounts only; Never paste production passwords here.
