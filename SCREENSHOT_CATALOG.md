# Screenshot Catalog

> **How to use this**: When you drop a screenshot into `public/screenshots/`, check it off here.
> When a feature update makes a screenshot stale, uncheck it and add `⚠️ STALE: reason`.
>
> **Path convention**: All screenshots live in `public/screenshots/` and are referenced in docs as `/screenshots/filename.png`.
