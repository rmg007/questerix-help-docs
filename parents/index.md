# Parents — Getting Started

Welcome to Questerix! This guide helps you set up your child's account and understand what you'll see once they start learning.

---

## What is Questerix?

Questerix is an adaptive practice platform. Your child answers questions, earns points, and builds mastery in subjects like Maths. The app adjusts to their level automatically — it gets easier when they're stuck and harder when they're doing well.

As a parent, you can see exactly how they're doing at any time.

## Step 2: Understand the Dashboard

When you log in, you'll see your child's learning summary. Here's what each section means:

| Section             | What It Shows                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Streak**          | How many days in a row your child has practiced |
| **Points**          | Total points earned across all sessions         |
| **Mastery**         | How well they know each topic (0–100%)          |
| **Recent Activity** | Their latest practice sessions with scores      |

## Step 3: Check Progress

**Problem:** You want to see which topics your child is struggling with.

**Solution:**

1. From the dashboard, tap **Progress**.
2. You'll see a list of topics (called Domains) and their mastery percentage.
3. Topics below 50% need more practice. Topics at 80%+ are well understood.

**Verification:** Each topic should have a coloured bar — green (strong), amber (improving), red (needs work).

## Step 4: Understand the Scoring

Your child earns points for every correct answer. Here's how it works:

- **First attempt correct** → Full points
- **Correct after a hint** → Partial points
- **Incorrect** → No points, but the question will come back again later

Questerix is designed so that getting something wrong is part of learning — it's not penalised, just repeated until mastered.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should my child use Questerix?

Even 10–15 minutes a day makes a real difference. The streak feature tracks daily practice — a longer streak means more consistent learning.

### What grade is my child practicing?

Your school administrator assigns your child to a specific grade app (for example, Math 7th Grade). You can see the name of the app at the top of your child's profile.

### Can my child use Questerix offline?

Yes. The student app works offline. Progress is synced automatically the next time the device connects to the internet.

### I can't see my child's account. What should I do?

Contact your school administrator. They manage which students are linked to which parent accounts.
