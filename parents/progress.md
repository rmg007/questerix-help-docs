# Viewing Your Child's Progress

Questerix gives parents a detailed view of their child's learning. This page explains everything you can see.

## The Mastery Score

Each topic in your child's curriculum has a **Mastery Score** from 0% to 100%.

| Score   | Meaning                                      |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0–40%   | Just started — needs regular practice        |
| 41–70%  | Making progress — keep going                 |
| 71–89%  | Good understanding — occasional review helps |
| 90–100% | Mastered — your child knows this topic well  |

The score goes up when your child answers questions correctly, and it slowly decays over time if they stop practicing. This is intentional — it reflects real memory, not just a one-time performance.

## Understanding Streaks

A **streak** counts how many days in a row your child has done at least one practice session.

- Streaks reset to zero if your child skips a day.
- The student app shows a flame icon 🔥 with the current streak count.
- Maintaining a streak is one of the best predictors of long-term learning outcomes.

::: tip Encourage consistent short sessions
A 10-minute daily session is more effective than a 2-hour session once a week.

## Session History

**Problem:** You want to see what your child practiced today.

**Solution:**

1. Log in to your parent account.
2. Click **Activity** from the menu.
3. You'll see a list of sessions, each showing:
   - Date and time
   - Topics practiced
   - Questions attempted and correct rate

**Verification:** Each session card should show a percentage score (e.g., "8/10 correct").

## What "Syncing" Means

If your child uses the app offline, their progress is saved locally on the device. When the device connects to the internet, the app automatically **syncs** to the server — and your parent view updates shortly after.

If you don't see recent activity, ask your child to open the app while connected to Wi-Fi to trigger a sync.
