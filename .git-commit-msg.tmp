feat: add automated screenshot pipeline + enforce doc rules

- Add Playwright screenshot capture (Flutter-aware, auto-login for test accounts)
- Add 16 high-res screenshots (parent/teacher/admin) to public/screenshots/
- Restore screenshot embeds in docs (were commented out due to missing files)
- Add npm run docs:check (enforces Problem→Solution→Verification + Last updated stamp)
- Add npm run screenshots:check (prevents missing screenshot references)
- Add CI workflow (.github/workflows/docs-check.yml) to enforce rules on every PR/push
- Add AI_CONTEXT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md for universal agent alignment
- Add .env.screenshots.local for reusable test credentials (git-ignored)
- Update SCREENSHOT_CATALOG.md to mark all captured screenshots as [x]
- Fix VitePress tip/warning blocks (:::: → :::)
