# Managing Groups

Groups are how you organise students in Questerix. Think of each group as a class or a teaching set.

---

## Create a Group

1. In the left sidebar, click **Groups**.
2. Click **New Group** (top right).
3. Give the group a clear name — e.g., "7B Maths" or "Set 1 - Period 3".
4. Click **Create Group**.

The group is now active and ready for students.

---

## Add Students to a Group

**Problem:** You created a group but it has no students yet.

**Solution:**

1. Click the group name in the sidebar.
2. Click **Add Students**.
3. Use the search box to find students by name.
4. Tick the students you want to add.
5. Click **Add to Group**.

**Verification:** The students appear in the **Members** tab of your group.

::: warning Students must have accounts first
If a student doesn't show up in the search, they don't have a Questerix account yet. Ask your school admin to create one.

## Remove a Student from a Group

1. Open the group.
2. Find the student in the **Members** tab.
3. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) next to their name.
4. Click **Remove from Group**.

The student's data is not deleted — they just leave this group.

---

## Archive a Group

When a term or year ends, you can archive a group instead of deleting it. This keeps the historical data but removes the group from your active view.

1. Open the group.
2. Click **Settings** (top right).
3. Click **Archive Group**.
4. Confirm the action.

---

## Rename a Group

1. Open the group.
2. Click **Settings** (top right).
3. Edit the group name.
4. Click **Save**.

---

## Group Member Limit

There is no hard limit on the number of students in a group. However, for practical reporting purposes, groups of 15–35 students are recommended.
