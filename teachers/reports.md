# Reading Reports

Questerix gives you several levels of reporting — from a quick class-wide overview down to a single student's answer on a specific question.

---

## Group Overview Report

**What it shows:** A snapshot of all students in a group — mastery, streaks, and last active date.

**How to access it:**

1. Click on a group in the sidebar.
2. The default view is the group overview.

**What to look for:**

| Signal                                | Action                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Student hasn't been active in 7+ days | Follow up — they may need encouragement |
| Streak is 0                           | The student hasn't practiced today      |
| Mastery < 40% on most topics          | May need extra support or intervention  |
| Mastery 90–100%                       | Student may be ready for harder content |

## Individual Student Report

**What it shows:** A full breakdown of one student's mastery across every topic in the curriculum.

**How to access it:**

1. Click on a group.
2. Click the student's name.
3. You'll see:
   - **By Domain**: Mastery percentage per major topic area
   - **By Skill**: Mastery for each individual skill within a domain
   - **Session History**: Every practice session with date, time, and score

---

## Question-Level Report

**What it shows:** Exactly which questions a student got right and wrong.

**How to access it:**

1. From the individual student view, click on a session from the **Session History**.
2. You'll see each question answered in that session:
   - The question text
   - The student's answer
   - Whether it was correct
   - How many attempts it took

::: tip Use this during parent–teacher meetings
The question-level report is very powerful in conversations with parents. It shows concrete evidence of what the student is struggling with — not just a percentage.

PDF export and CSV download are planned for a future update.

## Interpreting Mastery Decay

Mastery scores slowly decrease over time when a student doesn't practice a topic. This is by design — it reflects real memory, not just one-time performance.

If a student's mastery on a topic has dropped significantly since your last check, it likely means they haven't practiced it recently. Encourage them to revisit it before their next assessment.
