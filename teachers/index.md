## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I assign specific topics to students?

The curriculum is set at the school/app level by your admin. Students practice the questions assigned to their grade app. You can see which topics are available in the **Domains** view.

### A student says they can't log in. What should I do?

Ask the student to use **Forgot password** on the login page. If that doesn't help, contact your school admin — they can reset the account.

### Can students use Questerix on a tablet or phone?

Yes. The student app works on tablets and phones and supports offline mode. Progress syncs automatically when the device connects to the internet.

### How are questions created?

Questions are created by your school admin (or Questerix staff) using the Admin Panel. Teachers don't create questions — they focus on monitoring progress and supporting students.
